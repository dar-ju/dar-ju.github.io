          <h2 class="testimonials__essence">I&nbsp;received a&nbsp;job offer mid-course, and the subjects&nbsp;I learned were current, if&nbsp;not more&nbsp;so, in&nbsp;the company I&nbsp;joined. I honestly feel&nbsp;I got every penny&rsquo;s worth.</h2>
          <p class="testimonials__content">&quot; I&nbsp;was an&nbsp;EMT for many years before&nbsp;I joined the bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve been looking to&nbsp;make a transition and have heard some people who had an&nbsp;amazing experience here. I&nbsp;signed up&nbsp;for the free intro course and found it&nbsp;incredibly fun! I&nbsp;enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best&nbsp;&mdash; and most grueling - time of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. Since completing the course, I&rsquo;ve successfully switched careers, working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Software Engineer at&nbsp;a&nbsp;VR startup. &quot;</p>

          <p class="testimonials__content">&quot; The staff seem genuinely concerned about my&nbsp;progress which&nbsp;I find really refreshing. The program gave me&nbsp;the confidence necessary to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out in&nbsp;the world and present myself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;capable junior developer. The standard is&nbsp;above the rest. You will get the personal&nbsp;attention you need from an&nbsp;incredible community of&nbsp;smart and amazing people. &quot;</p>

          <p class="testimonials__content testimonials__content_color">&quot; Before joining the bootcamp, I&rsquo;ve never written a&nbsp;line of&nbsp;code. I&nbsp;needed some structure from professionals who can help me&nbsp;learn programming step by&nbsp;step. I&nbsp;was encouraged&nbsp;to enroll by&nbsp;a&nbsp;former student of&nbsp;theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and&nbsp;I never had to&nbsp;wait long for assistance. The agile team project,&nbsp;in particular, was outstanding. It&nbsp;took my&nbsp;learning to&nbsp;the next level&nbsp;in a&nbsp;way that no&nbsp;tutorial could ever have.&nbsp;In fact, I&rsquo;ve often referred to&nbsp;it&nbsp;during interviews as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example&nbsp;of&nbsp;my developent experience. It&nbsp;certainly helped me&nbsp;land a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.&nbsp;100% recommend! &quot;</p>
